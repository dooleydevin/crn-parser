reactions[n][0] =  for the nth reaction dictionary of reactant species: number
reactions[n][1] = for the nth reaction dictionary of product species: number
reactions[n][2] = rate constant of nth reaction

species = dictionary of species name: number of particles

rates[n] = current expected number of time steps for reaction n

log = list of species concentrations for each step
